        <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è This project was done for educational purposes only.</strong> Keep in mind that I created a subnet to launch this attack against. Performing this kind of activity on networks you do not own without permission is considered <span class="important">illegal.</span></p>

   <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
    <h3>The end goal of this project is to:</h3>
    <p>Utilize a <strong>Flipper Zero</strong> with an <strong>ESP32 Marauder</strong> board to analyze and capture Wi-Fi network traffic packets through a de-authorization attack. The collected packets will then be converted into a hash, which will be cracked using <strong>Hashcat</strong> through a dictionary attack.</p>

    </ul>
<h2>Summary of How the Devices and Technologies Will Accomplish This Goal</h2>

<p>
With the <strong>Flipper Zero</strong>, I started by scanning nearby access points to determine the network I was going to target. After establishing the network, I proceeded to sniff (the process of monitoring and capturing data packets that pass through a network) with the option of <strong>PMKID</strong> (Pairwise Master Key Identifier) and proceed with an <strong>Active-Forced Deauth attack</strong>, which disconnects the devices connected to the targeted network. 
</p>

<p>
(It is important to mention that this process only works on <strong>2.4GHz networks</strong>.)
</p>

<p>
While the de-authentication attack is actively running, the Flipper will collect <strong>EAPOL</strong> (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) data, which essentially translates to the <strong>4-way handshake</strong> needed to decrypt the password. (This portion alone can take <strong>5-10 minutes</strong>.)
</p>

<p>
I then proceeded to import the <strong>pcaps</strong> collected from the attack to my Kali box, open them in <strong>Wireshark</strong>, and search for:
</p>

<pre>wlan.ssid == "Flipping Scary!" || eapol</pre>

<p>
(<em>"Flipping Scary!" is the name of the targeted AP.</em>)  
This step ensures that the <strong>EAPOL 4-way handshake</strong> was effectively captured. Then I converted the <strong>pcap</strong> into a <strong>hash</strong> using 
<a href="https://hashcat.net/cap2hashcat/">cap2hashcat</a>.
</p>

<p>
The last step of the project was executed in the terminal, where I used <strong>Hashcat</strong> in conjunction with the <strong>rockyou.txt</strong> wordlist to crack the password. I launched a <strong>dictionary attack</strong> that gave me the hash value to gain access to the targeted network.

   <h2>Further Possibilities of this Exploitation</h2>
    <p>While I only cracked the password of a Wi-Fi network, this can be seen as the first step toward more severe exploits. If someone gains unauthorized access to your Wi-Fi network, it could lead to serious security risks, including:</p>

  <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Interception:</strong> Attackers can intercept sensitive information such as passwords, personal messages, and financial data.</li>
        <li><strong>Bandwidth Theft:</strong> Unauthorized users can slow down your internet speed and even cause overage charges from your ISP.</li>
        <li><strong>Malware Distribution:</strong> An attacker could spread malware across your network, compromising connected devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Attacks:</strong> Unauthorized users can use your connection to launch attacks on other devices or external targets.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Breach:</strong> Attackers can monitor your online activity and gather personal information for malicious purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Access to Connected Devices:</strong> Weak network security can allow attackers to control smart devices like cameras or home automation systems.</li>
    </ul>

   <h2>How to Address and Prevent De-authentication Attacks</h2>
    <p>To protect your Wi-Fi network from de-authentication attacks and packet sniffing, implement the following security measures:</p>

   <ul>
        <li><strong>Use WPA3 Encryption:</strong> Upgrade your Wi-Fi security to <strong>WPA3</strong> if supported. It offers stronger protection compared to WPA2.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Passwords:</strong> Use complex passwords (12-16 characters long) and avoid common phrases.</li>
        <li><strong>Disable WPS:</strong> Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is vulnerable to attacks. Turn it off in your router settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Firmware Updates:</strong> Keep your router firmware updated to patch known security vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>MAC Address Filtering:</strong> Restrict network access to known devices using MAC filtering (though not foolproof).</li>
        <li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> Create separate networks for guests and IoT devices to limit potential exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Disable SSID Broadcasting:</strong> Hiding your SSID makes your network less visible to casual users.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a VPN:</strong> Encrypt internet traffic using a Virtual Private Network (VPN), especially on public networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):</strong> Monitor suspicious activity and respond to threats in real time.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Signal Range:</strong> Adjust router settings to reduce the Wi-Fi signal range outside your property.</li>
        <li><strong>Disable Remote Management:</strong> Turn off remote management features unless absolutely necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Network Traffic:</strong> Regularly check for unauthorized devices or unusual traffic patterns.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Implementing these measures will significantly improve the security of your Wi-Fi network against <strong>de-authentication attacks</strong> and <strong>packet sniffing</strong>.</p>
