    <h1>Penetration Test Report - MegaCorpOne</h1>
  
[JEUM Penetration Test Report - MegaCorpOne](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19372047/Javier.Urena.s.Penetration.Test.Report.-.MegaCorpOne.1.zip)
    
  <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <p>MegaCorpOne engaged JEUM Cyber Solutions LLC to conduct an internal and external penetration test on its network infrastructure and web applications. The goal was to assess security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations to enhance security posture.</p>
    
  <h2>Scope and Parameters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Target:</strong> MegaCorpOne's internal network, external-facing applications, and services.</li>
        <li><strong>IP Ranges Tested:</strong> 172.16.117.0/16, MCO.local, *.megacorpone.com.</li>
        <li><strong>Objectives:</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify and exfiltrate sensitive data.</li>
                <li>Escalate privileges to the domain administrator level.</li>
                <li>Compromise at least two machines.</li>
                (Insert network architecture diagram here)
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
   <h2>Issues Found and Exploitations</h2>
    
  <h3>1. Public Exposure of Administrator Information (Critical)</h3>
    <p><strong>Findings:</strong> C-level and admin user emails and social media were available on the company website.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> This information can be used for phishing attacks and social engineering attempts.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Remove sensitive contact details from public web pages.</p>

  <h3>2. Weak Passwords and Unhashed Password Storage (Critical)</h3>
    <p><strong>Findings:</strong> Poor password policies allowed brute-force attacks. Additionally, unhashed passwords were found in local files.</p>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased risk of unauthorized access.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Implement strong password policies, enforce multi-factor authentication, and hash stored passwords.</p>

   <h3>3. Open and Unnecessary Ports (High)</h3>
    <p><strong>Findings:</strong> Several open ports exposed critical services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>FTP (21) and Telnet (23): Transmitting data in plain text.</li>
        <li>HTTP (80): Potential web-based vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>SSH (22) and VNC (5900): Targets for brute-force attacks.</li>
        <li>SMB (139, 445): File-sharing risks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Increased attack surface and potential unauthorized access.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Close unnecessary ports, enforce firewalls, and use encrypted communication protocols.</p>

   <h3>4. Exploited Services and Successful Attacks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FTP Backdoor (Port 21):</strong> Allowed unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>SSH Brute-Force (Port 22):</strong> Weak credentials exploited.</li>
        <li><strong>Telnet Login (Port 23):</strong> Gained access through default credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP Version Scanning (Port 80):</strong> Identified outdated services.</li>
        <li><strong>RPC Exploitation (Port 111):</strong> Compromised remote access.</li>
        <li><strong>SMB Exploitation:</strong> Gained control over shared resources.</li>

    </ul>
    
  <h3>5. Privilege Escalation & Lateral Movement</h3>
    <p><strong>Findings:</strong> Weak credentials allowed attackers to move across systems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Password Spraying Attack: Compromised user account.</li>
        <li>LLMNR Poisoning: Captured and cracked NTLM hashes.</li>
        <li>Windows Payload Upload: Remote execution of malicious scripts.</li>
        <li>Persistence: Created a stealthy backdoor user.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Implement strong authentication mechanisms, disable LLMNR, and monitor privilege escalations.</p>

   <h2>Recommendations and Remediation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Close unnecessary ports and services (e.g., FTP, Telnet).</li>
        <li>Enhance password policies (minimum 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, special character).</li>
        <li>Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical access.</li>
        <li>Remove public administrator details from web pages.</li>
        <li>Apply patches and updates to vulnerable services.</li>
        <li>Enforce network segmentation to prevent lateral movement.</li>
        <li>Implement security monitoring tools (e.g., IDS/IPS).</li>

    </ul>
    
   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The assessment identified multiple critical vulnerabilities, including weak passwords, exposed sensitive information, and open ports. These weaknesses pose a significant risk to MegaCorpOne's security. By addressing the identified issues and implementing the recommended solutions, the organization can greatly reduce its attack surface and strengthen its overall cybersecurity posture.</p>
    <p>Immediate action is required to mitigate these threats, ensuring that MegaCorpOne's systems are safeguarded against potential cyberattacks.</p>
